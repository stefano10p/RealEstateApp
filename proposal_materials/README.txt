Hello David!

I hope you like my project idea :).
In this submission you will find a docx and an xlsm file.
The docx file contains my written proposal.
The xlsm file contains a working excel version of the application I intend to build.

While time consuming, I found it extremely useful to construct an excel based version (or at least a partial version) of
my intended work product. It has helped me better understand the scope of the application, and it has allowed me to capture
all of the "functionality" that I must create before I've begun writing any code. I feel like I already have a pretty clear road
map of what to do and how to do it. I hope that the excel version will prove useful to you as well, if you decide to look at it.
You'll very quickly be able to get a strong visual sense of what I'm aiming for and hopefully it can help you judge the idea more quickly.

As always, I look forward to your feedback.

best,

-Stefano
