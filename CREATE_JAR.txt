Notes on creating jar file:

In the directory that contains your source code:
1. create a manifest.txt file
2. populate the manifest.txt file like this:
Main-Class: LaunchRealEstateApp


NOTE: The LanchRealEstateApp is the name of the class
that contains your main method. Also note the two 2 empty lines (hit enter twice)

3. Compile your code. In our case: javac LaunchRealEstateApp.java
4. run the command:  jar cfm RealEstateApp.jar manifest.txt LaunchRealEstateApp.class MathHelper.class Amortization.class BackEndCalculations.class RealEstateFrontEnd\$InputListener.class WelcomeView\$WelcomeListener.class WelcomeView.class BackEndCalculations.class RealEstateFrontEnd.class

Essentially, asfter the cfm flag we provide the output name of the jar file. We then provide the manifest.txt file.
What follows is the list of all class files our application depends on. So basically all class files in the folder where we compiled the code.

You should now be able to double click on the jar file and launch the application.
