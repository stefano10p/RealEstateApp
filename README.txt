Hello David!

Here are some high-level notes describing the material I included in this submission.

All of my source code is included in the code directory. I compiled a jar file that you can
use to launch the app. Alternatively please feel free to compile the: LaunchRealEstateApp.java
file. When you do that, all other classes will be compiled and you will be able to launch the application
from the command line: java LaunchRealEstateApp.

The ProjectReport.docx is my writeup describing my project in detail. There is also a pdf version if
you prefer that type of rendering.

The proposal material I submitted to you earlier in the semester is included in the proposal materials directory.

Note on length of code: This piece of software is doing a fair bit :) and given the amount and complexity of some
of the computations and the number of calculations required there was a need to write a lot of code.
I believe the amount of code reflects the complexity of the problem being solved and I wanted to bring
that to your attention.

-Stefano
